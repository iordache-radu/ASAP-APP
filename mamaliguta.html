<p style="font-size:20px">This is the original way to make Mamaliga, the Romanian polenta. When my parents were growing up this was the staple food and bread was not something they were eating everyday. I remember my grandmother making this is a round black bottom cast iron pan that looked more like a hat if turned upside down.On summer vacations I'd eat this at my grandma's house,but nowadays it's more like a treat.<p>
<p style="font-size:50px" >Ingredients</p>
<p >    1 cup cornmeal</p>
<p >    2 cups water</p>
<p >    1 teaspoon salt</p>
