<p style="font-size:20px">This is the original way to make Mamaliga, the Romanian polenta. When my parents were growing up this was the staple food and bread was not something they were eating everyday. I remember my grandmother making this is a round black bottom cast iron pan that looked more like a hat if turned upside down.On summer vacations I'd eat this at my grandma's house,but nowadays it's more like a treat.<p>
<p style="font-size:50px" >Ingredients</p>
<p >    1 cup cornmeal</p>
<p >    2 cups water</p>
<p >    1 teaspoon salt</p>

<p>Heat the water and add the salt. </p>
<p>When the water starts to boil, pour the cornmeal all at once and start stirring with a wooden spoon. </p>
<p>The cornmeal will begin to bubble soon, at which point turn the heat down, but carry on stirring to prevent the formation of lumps. </p>
<p>Wet the tail end of a wooden spoon with water and insert it into the mamaliga. If it is done, this will come out clean.</p>
